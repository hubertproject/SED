# SED

This project, named SED, leverages React, Tailwind, and Paystack to provide a seamless user experience and secure payment integration. The website allows interested individuals to register and fill out an application form after purchasing it.

Upon visiting the site, users can easily navigate through a user-friendly interface designed with Tailwind. The registration process is straightforward, guiding users through each step efficiently. After registration, users are directed to purchase the application form via Paystack, ensuring secure and swift transactions.

Once the payment is successful, users can access and complete the application form. Additionally, I have used noAPI to connect the forms to Google Sheets, which serves as the database for storing user information. The entire process is designed to be intuitive, making it easy for users to register, pay, and apply without any hassle.

This project showcases my ability to integrate modern technologies, payment solutions, and database connectivity to create a functional and user-friendly web application.
